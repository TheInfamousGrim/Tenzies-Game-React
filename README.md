## Description

This was a great project to work on as I gained a great understanding of how to use Tailwind and DaisyUI to make accessible UI and UX. I chose Tenzies as it's a great way to create a game that requires a nice bit of logic and to get a better understanding of React state management and the useEffect hook.
